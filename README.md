# Linear Genetic Programming for Python (LGP4PY)

This project implements linear genetic programming algorithms in Python. The main feature of this project is that it decouples the algorithm implementations and problem applications, which facilitates the application to other domains. This project is developed based on the architecture of the JAVA project [Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) and Applications](https://github.com/Zhixing1020/Linear-Genetic-Programming-LGP-and-Applications).

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a package for fast deployment of Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) and its collaboration with Python-based machine learning packages, written by Zhixing Huang.
* Version 1.0.0
* Python 3.12

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Clone the repo to your local device.
2. Run `src/lgp.py` as a simple test, ```python .\src\lgp.py```.

### Project structure ###

* `src` defines the abstract algorithms.
* `tasks` defines the task-specific code, extended from the abstract algorithms. `tasks` also defines the task template and other generally useful templates.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Email: zhixing.huang@ecs.vuw.ac.nz
