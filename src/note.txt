 embed the multi breeding pipeline into Evolution framework directly.

the base parameter in "breeder.py" should be "pop.subpop.0.species.pipe". To see change the "pipe" or not

for each individual   add a variable recording the pipeline that produces it

LGPIndividual4SR  is a merge of LGPIndividual4SR & LGPIndividual4SRMT

I get rid of the tree constraint, and replace its role by GPSpecies


******** question *********
what is GPinitializer  for?

******** change *******
GPNodeGatherer   -->  only for a memory address to store GPNode in a function

cloneReplacing()  --> change to clone()

********   disgard *********

GPNodeconstraint    -->   node constraints are fulfilled by checking the number of children


no Exchanger

no hash code


********  test  ********
1. randomly produce individuals （ok）
2. clone a tree and vary it. check the new and original one
3. check the toString() methods of GPNode and GPTree (ok)
4. number of nodes and collect a node based on specific types
5. node equivalent and tree equivalent

6. breeding pipeline  properly set up
7. the returning   tuple[int, list[GPIndividual]]   can it work well.  each individual has its own address,  the crossover and mutation have different returning number,  it does not overwrite the elite individuals,
